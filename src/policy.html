            these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance
            with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or
            accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark
            law.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Use License</h3>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on BitTacklr's website
                for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title,
                and under this license you may not:

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on BitTacklr's website;</li>
                    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                    <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
                BitTacklr at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license,
                you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>The materials on BitTacklr's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. BitTacklr makes no warranties, expressed
                or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
                warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
                property or other violation of rights.</li>
            <li>Further, BitTacklr does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability
                of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked
                to this site.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Limitations</h3>

        <p>In no event shall BitTacklr or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for
            loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials
            on BitTacklr's website, even if BitTacklr or a BitTacklr authorized representative has been notified orally or
            in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
            to you.</p>

        <h3>5. Accuracy of materials</h3>

        <p>The materials appearing on BitTacklr's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. BitTacklr
            does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. BitTacklr may
            make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However BitTacklr does
            not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>

        <h3>6. Links</h3>

        <p>BitTacklr has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any
            such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by BitTacklr of the site. Use of any such
            linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>

        <h3>7. Modifications</h3>

        <p>BitTacklr may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you
            are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>

        <h3>8. Governing Law</h3>

            submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Belgium.</p>

            <li>We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as

            <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management
                of personal information.</li>
            <li>We will only retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.</li>
