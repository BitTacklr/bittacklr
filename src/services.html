        <p><strong>BitTacklr</strong> offers bespoke advice, guidance, training and workshops on the subject of Domain Driven Design (<strong>DDD</strong>), Command and Query Responsibility Seggregation (<strong>CQRS</strong>), Event Sourcing (<strong>ES</strong>), Messaging and Service Orientation, next to software analysis, design &amp; development.<br>
These offerings can tailored to whatever timescale fits your needs, whether it be a few hours, a couple of days or a collaboration that spans multiple years. Don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html" alt="Contact us" title="Contact us">contact</a> us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our core values are <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>quality</strong>, which manifest themselves by our relentless focus on reliability, efficiency, security, testability &amp; maintainability.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Past work involved building web-native, multi-user <strong>products</strong> with enterprise scale features such as high configurability by end users, authentication &amp; authorization, printing &amp; reporting, integration with third parties &amp; devices using both messaging and remote procedure calls. We've analyzed, designed, visualized, documented, fleshed out models, architected solutions into befitting sizes, wrote automated test specifications at the unit, integration, story, and UI level, wrote code at every layer and tier in the stack, scripted deployments and engaged in the operational side of running software at customer sites, all in order to <strong>satisfy</strong> requirements and <strong>customer happiness</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We <strong>bridge the gap</strong> between customers, their end users, your product management, sales and marketing, your technology of choice, your team, their problems and your solutions. Requirements gathering at customer sites, facilitation during agile planning meetings, teaching during coding dojos, presentation during knowledge transfer sessions, are but a few of our past efforts. It's safe to say that <strong>teaching</strong> and <strong>learning</strong> are the only constants.</p>
